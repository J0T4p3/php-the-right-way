# PHP: The Right Way - Project-Driven Learning Path üêò

## Overview

This repository documents my **project-driven learning journey** through **PHP: The Right Way** (https://phptherightway.com). Rather than following a linear chapter-by-chapter approach, this path emphasizes building real projects while using the book as a **quality assurance guide** and **curated resource directory**.

## Learning Philosophy

**"PHP: The Right Way" is NOT a traditional textbook** - it's a reference guide that points to the best resources for each topic. This learning path treats it as:
- ‚úÖ **Quality Standards Guide** - How to write good PHP code
- ‚úÖ **Best Practices Reference** - What practices to follow
- ‚úÖ **Curated Resource Directory** - Where to find quality learning materials
- ‚ùå **NOT a step-by-step tutorial** - Don't try to read everything linearly

## üéØ How to Use "PHP: The Right Way" Effectively

### **‚úÖ DO This:**
- **Skim overview first** - Get the big picture in 2-3 hours
- **Reference during projects** - Look up best practices when implementing features

- **Implement incrementally** - Add better practices to existing projects

### **‚ùå DON'T Do This:**
- **Read linearly** - You'll get overwhelmed and never start building
- **Follow every external link** - You'll fall into tutorial hell
- **Try to master everything upfront** - Start building with basic knowledge
- **Implement every pattern immediately** - Add complexity gradually
- **Skip the projects** - Theory without practice doesn't stick

### **üìö External Resource Strategy:**
**Immediate Priority (Follow These):**
- Basic PHP syntax and superglobals
